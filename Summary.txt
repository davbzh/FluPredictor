Project Description: 	
	Prior scholars have done a couple of researches about the potential of social media in prediction of disease outbreak. In this project we want to build a disease predictive system based on social media (Twitter). Our prediction system will send an alert to users when itâ€™s likely to be a outbreak of flu. Before getting the results of the flu, a user must select a location. (See User Manual for more detailed instructions).
