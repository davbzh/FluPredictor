Flu Prediction System

Project Description: 	
	Prior scholars have done a couple of researches about the potential of social media in prediction of disease outbreak. In this project we want to build a disease predictive system based on social media (Twitter). Our prediction system will send an alert to users when it’s likely to be a outbreak of flu. Before getting the results of the flu, a user must select a location. (See User Manual for more detailed instructions).

Work Breakdown:

Twitter API: Juncheng Chen
Data Analysis & Algorithm: Luyi Yang
User Interface: Xiang Zhang

Note: Although each of the three parts has its own main contributor, it shares everyone’s contributions and we all participated during the entire process.
